Research however has shown that computing nearest neighbors of a point from a high-dimensional data set generally requires time proportional to the size of the data set itself, rendering the computation of the nearest-neighbors graph prohibitively expensive.},

  abstract      = {Matrix sketching is a recently developed data compression technique. An input matrix A is efficiently approximated with a smaller matrix B, so that B preserves most of the properties of A up to some guaranteed approximation ratio. In so doing numerical operations on big data sets become faster. Sketching algorithms generally use random projections to compress the original dataset and this stochastic generation process makes them amenable to statistical analysis. The statistical properties of sketching algorithms have been widely studied in the context of multiple linear regression. In this paper we propose matrix sketching as a tool for rebalancing class sizes in supervised classification with imbalanced classes. It is well-known in fact that class imbalance may lead to poor classification performances especially as far as the minority class is concerned.},

  abstract      = {Dynamic and temporal graphs are rich data structures that are used to model complex relationships between entities over time. In particular, anomaly detection in temporal graphs is crucial for many real world applications such as intrusion identification in network systems, detection of ecosystem disturbances and detection of epidemic outbreaks. In this paper, we focus on change point detection in dynamic graphs and address two main challenges associated with this problem: I) how to compare graph snapshots across time, II) how to capture temporal dependencies. To solve the above challenges, we propose Laplacian Anomaly Detection (LAD) which uses the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix of the graph structure at each snapshot to obtain low dimensional embeddings. LAD explicitly models short term and long term dependencies by applying two sliding windows. In synthetic experiments, LAD outperforms the state-of-the-art method. We also evaluate our method on three real dynamic networks: UCI message network, US senate co-sponsorship network and Canadian bill voting network. In all three datasets, we demonstrate that our method can more effectively identify anomalous time points according to significant real world events.},

  abstract  = {A sketch of a matrix A is another matrix B which is significantly smaller than A but still approximates it well. Finding such sketches efficiently is an important building block in modern algorithms for approximating, for example, the PCA of massive matrices. This task is made more challenging in the streaming model, where each row of the input matrix can only be processed once and storage is severely limited. In this paper we adapt a well known streaming algorithm for approximating item frequencies to the matrix sketching setting. The algorithm receives n rows of a large matrix A {$\epsilon$} {$\mathfrak{R}$} n x m one after the other in a streaming fashion. It maintains a sketch B {$\mathfrak{R}$} l x m containing only l {$<<$} n rows but still guarantees that ATA BTB. More accurately, {$\forall$}x || x,||=1 0{$\leq$}||Ax||2 - ||Bx||2 {$\leq$} 2||A||\_f 2 l Or BTB prec ATA and ||ATA - BTB|| {$\leq$} 2 ||A||f2 l. This gives a streaming algorithm whose error decays proportional to 1/l using O(ml) space. For comparison, random-projection, hashing or sampling based algorithms produce convergence bounds proportional to 1/{$\surd$}l. Sketch updates per row in A require amortized O(ml) operations and the algorithm is perfectly parallelizable. Our experiments corroborate the algorithm's scalability and improved convergence rate. The presented algorithm also stands out in that it is deterministic, simple to implement and elementary to prove.},

Much of the expensive computation can then be performed on the smaller matrix, thereby accelerating the solution for the original problem. In this survey we consider least squares as well as robust regression problems, low rank approximation, and graph sparsification. We also discuss a number of variants of these problems. Finally, we discuss the limitations of sketching methods.},
